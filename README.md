# objdict
Object Dictionary for LabVIEW 2015+

# API Documentation

# Error Handling
This API is basically a thoughtful wrapper for the Variant and Data Value Reference APIs. As such, it largely passes errors generated by those APIs out to the caller. Where sanity checks or other "safety" logic would cause the API to generate an error, code 5000 is used unilaterally, and the unique error information is written into the Description string.

TODO - Link to blog post about using 5000+string instead of unique codes

# Tests
One simplistic performance test is included in the _tests folder. (It's simplistic in design, which naturally makes it big, ugly, and ungainly in implementation. Sorry for the yucky code.) It demonstrates the marked performance advantage of using a dict of object DVRs in lieu of a by-value dict of the objects themselves. These are representative results of running it on a Windows 7 machine with an Intel Core i7-5600U CPU (Lenovo T450s laptop).

TODO - paste tables of test results
